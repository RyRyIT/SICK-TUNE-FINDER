# Project Name "SICK TUNE FINDER"
- The purpose of this project is to create an application that allows the user to search for an Artist, Album, and Song information.
- Everything starts with the artist (Band Name) and drills down from there rendering available albums, track listings, lyrics and artist biographical information.

# Step 1. Start with the Artist (Band Name) search
- type your search text into the input box and hit the enter key or click on the "Artist" button
- this search will generate buttons for available artist with the search term in it for further drill down.
- Generally, this works perfectly.
    + in some cases, searching for a portion of an artist name will not return the target artist. 
    + Example: searching for non or point does NOT return nonpoint.

# Step 2. Select the artist from the selection available.
- If artist buttons are NOT created try the artist search again using more word, less words, or different words.
- Clicking on an artist button will generate the available albums and create buttons for further drill down.
- Clicking on the artist generate the subgenre, genre, artist city and biography in the right window area.
